#Comet Skirmish

This game was a project for college, instumentation and design course.

The game is developed using HTML5, canvas with Animate.

I've added hammer-time.js for touch support.

Rules: you play as a ship pilot, navigating through a course of asteroids.
You can fire boosters left and right, but they take time to recharge after boosting.
You can also fire a laser cannon, but it also needs to recharge.

Controls: left/right directional keys (or swipe) to boost.
spacebar (or touch press) to fire.

All assets are my own, except for some sound FX used from freesounds.org - I'll credit them here
